# OctoAcme Project Management — Quick Reference

OctoAcme runs projects through a clear, repeatable lifecycle: initiation, planning, execution, release, and close. Initiation captures the opportunity in a lightweight Project One‑pager (problem, goals, success metrics, stakeholders) and a go/no‑go decision. Planning turns approved initiatives into prioritized, estimated backlog items with acceptance criteria, a Definition of Done, and a milestone map. Execution follows iterative delivery with timeboxed planning, capacity-aware pull of work, and a risk register to track dependencies and mitigations.

Workflows are centered on a project board (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, Done) and a disciplined Pull Request process. PRs should be small and reviewable, include the related issue and acceptance criteria, run CI (tests and linting) before review, and require at least one approval before merge. Releases follow a checklist (passing CI/security scans, release notes, rollback plan, staging smoke tests) and use automated pipelines where possible, with post‑deploy verification and a rollback/incident playbook for failures.

Roles and responsibilities are explicit: Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, risks, and communications; Product Managers define outcomes, prioritize work, and measure success; Developers build and test features; QA validates acceptance criteria; and Stakeholders provide inputs and approvals. Typical cadences include short daily standups, a weekly PM+PdM alignment, delivery syncs and demos at the end of sprints or milestones, and monthly stakeholder updates. Risks are tracked in a simple register and escalated from team triage to PM/Product Lead and, if needed, sponsor-level involvement.

Quality assurance is enforced through multi-level testing (unit, integration, end‑to‑end smoke tests), security scanning in CI, and manual QA where required. The process emphasizes small, testable increments, clear acceptance criteria, and a Definition of Done to keep work shippable. Retrospectives after sprints, releases, or incidents capture "what went well" and prioritized action items, which are added back into the backlog to measure impact and drive continuous improvement.
